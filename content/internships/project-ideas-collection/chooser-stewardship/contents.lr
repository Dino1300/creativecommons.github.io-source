title: Chooser project stewardship
---
problem:
Many online platforms use Creative Commons licenses for user-generated content. 

It is helpful to allow creators to choose their own Creative Commons license. The Creative Commons Chooser guides content creators when choosing their Creative Commons license terms.

Since third-party projects use Chooser, we want to make it convenient and straightforward to integrate the component into diverse software systems. We also want to ensure a stable and consistent Chooser user experience.
