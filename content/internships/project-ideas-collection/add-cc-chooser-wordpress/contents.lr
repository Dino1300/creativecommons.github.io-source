title: Add CC Chooser to CC WordPress Plugin
---
problem:
Currently, we have a license selector on the admin panel that works fine but it
can be improved by using the workflow of the new CC Chooser. We also have a set
of Gutenberg blocks to insert a license in the content, we can also add a new
block that can contain the CC Chooser workflow as well, this will improve the
user experience and would be more educational regarding the CC Licenses.
---
expected_outcome:
Revamping the admin panel of the plugin, adding the CC Chooser on it as well as
a Gutenberg block.
---
internship_tasks:
The intern will be expected to:
- Research about how the new CC Chooser manage the user workflow
- Recreate that process in the WordPress admin panel
- Generate a new Gutenberg block
---
application_tips:
The intern should be able to plan this process and find the best way to adapt
the workflow from the CC Chooser (JavaScript/Vue) to WordPress (PHP).
