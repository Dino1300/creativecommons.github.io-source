## Past: Moved to Slack

In 2016, Creative Commons (CC) moved to Slack as our primary messaging platform
([We're on Slack! Join us! - Creative Commons][onslack]). We are very thankful
for the generous support that Slack has provided. The Slack messaging platform
is far more accessible than IRC. We saw an immediate and sustained increase in
our messaging community ([A month of Slack: Growing global communities every
day - Creative Commons,  Lessons learned from a year of Slack, 1000 members,
and immeasurable community growth - Creative Commons][monthofslack]). We
currently have 10,293 members in our Slack workspace. Of those, we see daily
activity from an average of 250 of them spread across almost 70 public
channels. The Slack platform is not without valid criticisms, but those will be
addressed in the Future: Open Source section, below.

## Present: Dropping IRC

When CC moved to Slack, we also set up a bridge with our three IRC channels on
Freenode. However those channels only see ones of active users and tens of
messages per year. With the hostile takeover of Freenode in 2021, the
Free/Libre and Open Source (FOSS) community has largely moved to
[libera.chat][liberachat]. However, we will not be moving our Slack/IRC bridge
there. **Effective 2022-01-24 we are dropping IRC as an officially supported
messaging platform.** In addition to there having been very few active users on
IRC, many of the active IRC users also have active Slack accounts. Dropping IRC
will allow us to better allocate our technical resources to better serve the
community as a whole.

## Future: Open Source

Over the years, Slack has had performance and UX issues. It is also designed
around assumptions that do not fit a large open community. Those issues have
not prevented it from being a strong and capable messaging platform that has
served our community well. However, an Open Source messaging platform would
better align with the Creative Commons community and the values we champion.
The Open Source and Open Content communities have long enjoyed a significant
overlap and collaboration. With regards to messaging, we hope to increase that
overlap in the next year or two.
